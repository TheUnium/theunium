# Who am I?
I am **unium** (shocking, I know), an Indian developer and designer. **I mainly specialize in C and Java**, however I can also do web development [(check out my website!)](https://theunium.github.io/).
My hobbies apart from programming include painting, mathematics, physics, biology, boxing, wrestling, football and more. I also play minecraft and geometry dash!

# My background
I am a high school student from India, and was born in Bihar. I started learning how to program pretty early on in around late 2016 to early 2017. I started my journey by learning Java,
which is a move I still regret to this day, along with C. I primarily learnt programming through books that my mother/elder cousin(s) had let me borrow, later using online resources to learn kotlin,
 lua, etc.

# Stuff I know/use
[![langs i know](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,cpp,php,java,html,css,js,nodejs&theme=dark)](https://skillicons.dev)<br>
Displayed above are the languages I know, **and** use regularly. I know a few more languages, however I rarely use them, such as rust.
Other than that, I daily drive [**debian**](https://www.debian.org/) with [**KDE Plasma**](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/).
